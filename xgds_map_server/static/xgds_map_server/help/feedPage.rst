**Google Earth Feed Page** lets you view most of the map layers in Google Earth.  We recommend instead using xGDS internal map pages.

Open in Google Earth:
---------------------

Click the *Open in Google Earth* button to download a kml file which contains the network link for xGDS.  You only have to do this once; once you have downloaded it you can just reopen that file.
You will have to enter your username and password from Google Earth.

Get Google Earth:
-----------------

If you don't have the Google Earth application installed you can get it by clicking the *Get Google Earth* button.
